This website is designed to show solutions and possibilities for the Rabbit in the Hole Challenge.

## 📜 What is the challenge?
There are 100 holes 🕳️ in a line, and there's a rabbit 🐰 hiding in one of the holes

You can only look in one hole at a time, and every time you look in a hole, the rabbit jumps to an adjacent hole. **Find the rabbit!**
